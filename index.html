			<h2>Lee An's Project Website</h2>
			<p>This is my project web page for my elective modules Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals (EP1000) and Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping (EP1001). I will be documenting my progress through the course of my various projects here.</p>
			<h3>What is Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals?</h3>
			<p>The elective is organised around a self-directed project where students develop design thinking and prototyping skills. Students will be guided through a design thinking process followed by the development of a functional prototype. Students will apply design and digital fabrication process for developing a functional prototype that integrates these processes. Students will practise these skills in a design studio setting.</p>
			<h3>What is Further Digital Fabrication & Protoyping?</h3>
			<p>This elective module builds on the fundamentals of digital fabrication and prototyping learnt in module EP1000, and they will be exposed to a greater variety and deeper knowledge of digital fabrication machines and technology. The module is organised around a self-directed project which students will design and fabricate in the Fablab. Working in groups, students will be guided through the project development process followed by the implementation of a functional prototype. Students will apply design and fabrication process for developing a functional prototype that integrates both mechanical, electronics and embedded programming technologies. Students acquire further digital fabrication skills that enable them to produce creative and innovative solutions to challenges faced. Examples include internships, final year projects and grad shows.</p>
			<h3>Why Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping?</h3>
			<p>This elective is a continuation of the Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals module. In Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals, I was introduced to basic digital fabrication skills such as CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting and the arduino. In this elective, I will continue on my digital fabrication journey, learning additional skills such as CNC machining, designing and fabricating custom circuit boards, applications programming and the Internet of Things. This will help expand my arsneal of skills to create and design more complex solutions to solve problems in my life.</p>
