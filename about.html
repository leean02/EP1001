            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>From young, I have always been very curious and interested about the world around me. I would take apart things and fiddle with them to learn about how they work and how to assemble them back together. I would also spend days, weeks or even months indulging myself on any certain topic that tickled my fancy during that period of time. My hobbies includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calisthenics, weightlifting and exercising</li>
                <li>Building and tinkering with things</li>
                <li>Puzzles such as speedcubing</li>
                <li>Flying with Singapore Youth Flying Club</li>
            </ul>
